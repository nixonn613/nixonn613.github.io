## [EECS 494 P2 - Cat out of Water](https://nixonn613.itch.io/cat-out-of-water)
**A game featuring a cat that hates water, who can also change between the 3 states of water (liquid, vapor, gas) to navigate through levels.**
- Designed and developed a 2D platformer prototype centered on elemental state changes (vapor, ice, water) and their impact on movement and interaction.
- Built in Unity using C#, implementing core systems including player movement, environmental hazards, checkpoints, and level transitions.
- Conducted a midpoint playtest after one week to collect player feedback on clarity, difficulty, and pacing.
- Implemented a “Gold Spike” feature focusing on the limited-duration cloud-riding mechanic to explore tension and flow in mobility-based gameplay.

I’m a student developer interested in game design and programming (among many other things)!
This site showcases the games I've developed as part of my Major Design Experience via EECS 494.

## Q: Favorite Game(s)?

A: My favorite game changes often, but my favorites fall into the thriller, mystery, horror genre (some of my faves being Danganronpa, Until Dawn, The Quarry, Resident Evil). Anything with a rich story or something that will immerse into some storyline, will likely fall into my favorites (honorable mentions: Detroit: Become Human, Mouthwashing, Heavy Rain, Undertale). I love a lighthearted game too, though! Among my favorite, more lighthearted games are Stardew Valley, Infinity Nikki (pre-update, iykyk), and Tomodachi Life.
