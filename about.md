Iâ€™m a student developer interested in game design and programming.  
This site showcases the games I've developed as part of my Major Design Experience via EECS 494.

## Favorite Game?

My favorite game changes pretty often, but my favorites tend to fall into the thriller, mystery, horror-type genre (some of my faves being Danganronpa, Until Dawn, The Quarry, Resident Evil). Anything with a rich story, or even just something that will make me immersed into some storyline, will fall into my favorites (honorable mentions: Detroit: Become Human, Mouthwashing, Heavy Rain). 

## More coming soon...
